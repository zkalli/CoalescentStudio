								<h3>Cooperative Focus</h3>
								<p>Our intent is to re-popularize local multiplayer games, more lovingly known as “couch co-op” games. As improvements have kept on coming to online gaming, the genre has become more and more popular - and that’s great, don’t get us wrong. However, fast-paced, popular battle arena and battle royale games aren’t for everyone, and they aren’t for anyone all the time. We’ve decided it’s time to take off the headset, get up from your desk, and get back on your couch - where gaming began for many of us. </p>

								<p>We develop games made to be played together with your friends, partners, sisters, brothers, cousins, classmates, neighbors, babysitters, or whoever. The bottom line is, we make cooperative games designed to be played side-by-side in the same room, on the same screen. If the idea of going back to sharing your screen makes you nauseous, that’s okay. We get that what we do isn’t for everyone, but if you feel like you’re missing some much needed human interaction, we’re putting another option out into the market. Our games will push you not to just play together, but work together to succeed, so grab a controller and get comfortable. Your Saturday night in just became a lot more adventurous. </p>

								<h4>Adventure Awaits</h4>
								<p>There are a lot of multiplayer games out there, but many of them, while loads of fun, lack an adventurous spirit. Our games maintain a focus on adventurous storytelling. So many of the games people still play from the comfort of their couch are single-player games with strong narratives. Seeing as how much we love a good story in the games we play, we thought it would only be fitting that we combine our love for adventuring with our passion for cooperative games. So whether you find yourself exploring an ancient forest, dark underground caverns, or the back alleys of a metropolis, we hope your duo enjoys the journey.</p>
