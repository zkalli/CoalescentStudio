								<h3>2/11/2020: Near the Minimum Viable Product</h3>
								<p>We are nearing our first milestone - a working minimum viable product by February 14. We are slightly behind schedule due to programming delays, but should still be able to complete our user testing by February 21st. We are shifting the controls over to the gamepad, which is presenting some setbacks, but are working through it. Spencer has been working on the core animations for the blacksmith and the rig for the enemy tree, so neither are entirely complete yet, but both are close. Anything we might be lacking for the MVP we will use a placeholder animation for.</p>
								<p> </p>
								<p>We had a design discussion in which we determined we would move the blacksmith workshop from the top to the bottom of the screen. This has put UI art behind, because we want to re-evaluate it. However, Kalli has finished the enemy tree model and texture, as well as props (sword, hammer, and anvil). Our team is finishing up that work now to ensure we are ready to start playtesting next week!</p>

								<h3>2/2/2020: Working Steady</h3>
								<p>We are on track with our art assets and have nearly caught programming back up to speed. With some help from Brantly, Varun was able to get the rest of the tower placement and crafting system figured out. The smith is being animated, and the enemy tree is being modeled. We are getting into a good working rhythm.</p>
								<p> </p>
								<p>We met with our advisor, Rob Howard, and updated him on our progress. He also agreed to help us outsource our audio asset needs to students in his audio class, so we have audio covered. Playtesting will begin in about two weeks.</p>

								<br>
								<h3>1/27/2020: Programming Hold Ups</h3>
								<p>The smith model is complete and the texture is being polished.The smith rig is also done and animation is beginning soon! We will begin with just the core animations for the smith needed for the minimum viable product (walk, run, action, etc.). Art is progressing as planned, but programming is hitting some bumps in the road. After a discussion with Varun, the programming schedule has been shrunk - the final deadline has not been moved. He is busy getting graduate school applications in by January 31st, and he will be ramping up development after that. Still, progress is being made slowly on the game mechanics. We’ve begun work on the tower placement that the blacksmith will be able to do, and Varun will continue to focus on this mechanic while he works with Brantly McCord (a very helpful teaching assistant) to hammer out some issues with the crafting mechanic (pun certainly intended).</p>
								<p> </p>
								<p>Besides that, we’ve been marketing on <a href="https://twitter.com/CoalescentStud1">Twitter</a> and got more information about publishing a game on Steam from some Purdue students who have done it before. Those proceedings will begin soon, and we will be monitoring our presence on Twitter to see what we can do better.</p>

								<h3>1/21/2020: Week One, Done</h3>
								<p>Our first week back in production is over, and we’ve already got some great work done. Kallista has started and finished the blacksmith character model in record time, and will begin texturing it while Spencer works on getting the model rigged. We are running behind on the programming of the crafting system. Since this is the first major system we are developing for the game, we want to make sure we get it right and define our classes the best way we can to save some headaches later. To account for this, we will be re-evaluating the programming schedule over the next week to come to a solution.</p>
								<p> </p>
								<p>We’ve also devised a marketing schedule for the next three weeks. We will be focusing on building our <a href="https://twitter.com/CoalescentStud1">Twitter</a> account for now, while also keeping the website up to date. The work we currently have is not in a state to be marketed to the Polytechnic administration or CGT staff and faculty. Once the game is more complete we will advertise to the department for user testing and to spread the word about a more complete product.</p>

								<h3>1/14/2020: Back At It</h3>
									<p>We hope 2020 is treating everyone well so far. It’s time for us to get back into our working rhythms so we’ll be sharing a lot of updates in the next months! As you (hopefully) saw in our presentation below, we have a good start on the art and animations for the warrior character, as well as some basic functionality for two of our key features - local multiplayer and AI chasing behavior.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Moving forward we will be working on modelling the smith character, animating the warrior some more, and programming a crafting system. We’ll be sharing updates here, and on our <a href="https://twitter.com/CoalescentStud1">Twitter</a> account, so stay tuned! There may even be some bonus concept art in store...soon...</p>
								
								<br>
								<h3>12/4/2019: ‘Twas the Night Before Capstone</h3>
								<p>With our final presentation of the semester coming up tomorrow afternoon, we are happy to share our complete final presentation
									<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f9ds6get6nuyknqTpW23LuDUYX08aOtqZLY9uckCoEE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>
									. It reflects the direction we will be going come January 2020, when we will get into the full swing of development. The information in the presentation is based on our findings from our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xrlceethmEKh0qygqxMqPTUlvpjF4WUk/view?usp=sharing">Requirements Gathering</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xkVVOTvs85tGX94Afv3Okn1uG7Pw_pJq/view?usp=sharing">Project Charter</a>. You can also keep up with the prototype development we have completed on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFh01RNxyUA3KHzkU01EBQ">YouTube Channel</a> to find some short animations for the warrior and programming tests. And if you happen to enjoy Twitter, you can also follow our updates there too!

								<h3>11/21/2019: Game Pitches</h3>
								<p>We’ve been busy these past weeks defining all the details of our project, War Smith, in our project charter. We’ve consulted with our sponsors and advisor and were glad to be able to maintain creative control of the project. Along with the charter, we’ve put together our game design document and a Gantt chart to outline the schedule all the way to the end. The game will be complete in early April 2020 and released on Steam later that month!</p>

								<br>
								<h3>11/13/2019: Writing and Modeling</h3>
								<p>We are in the heat of project planning! Our Gantt chart is growing every day, spreadsheets are flying, and our project charter and game design document are coming to life. What’s even more exciting is that we’ve already begun some prototype development! You can take a look at the earliest stage of our warrior’s 3D model here, done by Kallista: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z9aLiNIRHF8">First Warrior Turnaround</a></p>
								<br>
								<p>Spencer is working hard to get that character rigged so he can begin animating. Stay tuned for some gameplay updates and some documentation!</p>
								<br>
								<h3>10/25/2019: Working Title</h3>
								<p>We are excited to announce that the project moving forward in development is War Smith (working title)! The team is particularly excited about developing this game, because there just are not a lot of popular co-op games similar to it. Keep checking in here to stay up to date on all our latest developments.</p>
								
								<br>
								<h3>10/15/2019: Game Pitches</h3>
								<p>Game mechanics decided and concept art created, our video pitches are finalized! They highlight the basic idea of the game, as well as the unique cooperative mechanics and scope. Find them on YouTube at the links below, along with links to brief design docs for each game, as well as an IRAC for what makes a good game pitch.</p>

								<h3>10/8/2019: Game Concept Art</h3>
								<p>Our team has brainstormed two game ideas, both with a focus on cooperative play. To help convey those ideas and their look, Kallista has put together some concept art for what we are currently calling War Smith and Soul Link. War Smith is a horde based tower defense game, while Soul Link is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
