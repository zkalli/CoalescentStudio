								<h3>12/4/2019: ‘Twas the Night Before Capstone</h3>
								<p>With our final presentation of the semester coming up tomorrow afternoon, we are happy to share our complete final presentation
									<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f9ds6get6nuyknqTpW23LuDUYX08aOtqZLY9uckCoEE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>
									. It reflects the direction we will be going come January 2020, when we will get into the full swing of development. The information in the presentation is based on our findings from our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xrlceethmEKh0qygqxMqPTUlvpjF4WUk/view?usp=sharing">Requirements Gathering</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xkVVOTvs85tGX94Afv3Okn1uG7Pw_pJq/view?usp=sharing">Project Charter</a>. You can also keep up with the prototype development we have completed on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFh01RNxyUA3KHzkU01EBQ">YouTube Channel</a> to find some short animations for the warrior and programming tests. And if you happen to enjoy Twitter, you can also follow our updates there too!

								<h3>11/21/2019: Game Pitches</h3>
								<p>We’ve been busy these past weeks defining all the details of our project, War Smith, in our project charter. We’ve consulted with our sponsors and advisor and were glad to be able to maintain creative control of the project. Along with the charter, we’ve put together our game design document and a Gantt chart to outline the schedule all the way to the end. The game will be complete in early April 2020 and released on Steam later that month!</p>

								<br>
								<h3>11/13/2019: Writing and Modeling</h3>
								<p>We are in the heat of project planning! Our Gantt chart is growing every day, spreadsheets are flying, and our project charter and game design document are coming to life. What’s even more exciting is that we’ve already begun some prototype development! You can take a look at the earliest stage of our warrior’s 3D model here, done by Kallista: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z9aLiNIRHF8">First Warrior Turnaround</a></p>
								<br>
								<p>Spencer is working hard to get that character rigged so he can begin animating. Stay tuned for some gameplay updates and some documentation!</p>
								<br>
								<h3>10/25/2019: Working Title</h3>
								<p>We are excited to announce that the project moving forward in development is War Smith (working title)! The team is particularly excited about developing this game, because there just are not a lot of popular co-op games similar to it. Keep checking in here to stay up to date on all our latest developments.</p>
								
								<br>
								<h3>10/15/2019: Game Pitches</h3>
								<p>Game mechanics decided and concept art created, our video pitches are finalized! They highlight the basic idea of the game, as well as the unique cooperative mechanics and scope. Find them on YouTube at the links below, along with links to brief design docs for each game, as well as an IRAC for what makes a good game pitch.</p>

								<h3>10/8/2019: Game Concept Art</h3>
								<p>Our team has brainstormed two game ideas, both with a focus on cooperative play. To help convey those ideas and their look, Kallista has put together some concept art for what we are currently calling War Smith and Soul Link. War Smith is a horde based tower defense game, while Soul Link is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
